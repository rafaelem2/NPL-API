Debut:
2024 Olympic Games in Paris, France.
National team:
2024.
Ritual:
The night before a big race, he tries to relax and think about other things. If he keeps thinking about the race, his heart beats faster, and he can't sleep. He has few rituals, but he always makes sure to have some candy and watches television before a race. “I like to watch HGTV shows because they calm me down. And I must have dark chocolate on standby.” (swimmingworldmagazine.com, 12 Oct 2022)
His race day routine involves starting the morning with a warm shower to wake up before breakfast, and leaving the hotel two hours before the race. Upon arriving at the pool, he takes his time to absorb the atmosphere before beginning his stretching routine. He enters the water around an hour before the race begins. “People think I’m crazy, but I get my suit on just 15 minutes before the race.” (swimmingworldmagazine.com, 12 Oct 2022)

Start:
Was first taught how to swim for safety purposes. As a youngster, he was coached by his mother. At college, he was coached by his father.
His mother Amy: “All three of my kids have been on the pool deck since they were in the car seat. They were always having to come with us to practice. Them watching the kids practice, it would be one of those things, ‘Hey, when can I join the swim team?’ It was, ‘You’re going to swim because you’re here'. If they weren’t swimming, they were vandalising the property.” (usaswimming.org, 21 Jan 2021)
Reason:
His parents encouraged him to explore other sports, not wanting him to swim simply because they did. However, he excelled in swimming, overshadowing his abilities in baseball, basketball, golf, soccer or tennis.""I just felt a connection to the sport. I saw so much potential in myself within swimming."" (usaswimming.org, 21 Jan 2021)
Philosophy:
Remains committed to his race plan while in the pool, regardless of what is going on around him, believing in his abilities and training to guide him towards his goals.","MILESTONES

Start:
Swam in his early years due to asthma and started trying various athletic disciplines at age 12. Focused on shot put and discus throw, events in which he won silver at the Brazilian U16 championships in 2014. “At age 14-15, I focused on shot put and discus throw, but I never stopped running. I believe this helped me because I gained in strength and power. It helped me when I focused on the sprints.” (ge.globo.com, 9 Aug 2023)
Reason:
""I took up athletics influenced by a physical education teacher. She encouraged me a lot to run as I was good at it. I then fell in a blessed cradle, in the hands of [coaches] Darci and Rosana.” (band.uol.com.br, 28 Jul 2023)
Training:
He trains on a charcoal track in his hometown of Sesi Santo Andre, in the greater Sao Paulo city area. “It is not an official track for World Athletics competitions. A charcoal track helps us avoid injuries as the impact is less. So I end up applying more strength. It can help us. It has pros and cons. I do my best there, train the best way possible and results are showing.” (ge.globo.com, 9 Aug 2023)","MILESTONES

During the Covid-19 pandemic, he took time off to do biomechanics tests that pushed him to make changes in his technique.
""I used to swim with a bigger number of strokes, 42 every 50 metres, and now I swim 38. Besides, we did a biomechanics analysis and we realised other things, for example, I turned a lot my hip and now I don't do it that much. I've become more efficient. It was difficult to do these changes because I was already adapted to them. Doing less strokes makes me feel more pain in my muscles but it will be worth in a long term.""

Injuries:
November 2021: Broken nose.
May 2020: Arthroscopic surgery on his left shoulder.
2019: Diagnosed with chondromalacia in his left knee, a condition where the cartilage deteriorates, softens and causes pain. The condition does not have a cure and has to be treated with ice after each training session. The injury did not prevent him from competing at the 2019 Pan American Games in Lima (PER) and the 2019 World Championships in Stuttgart (GER).

""Judo became more of an obligation. A change was needed. My father insisted I should stay in judo. He thought (gymnastics) would be only a hobby."" In 2008 coaches and club staff convinced his father he had a future in gymnastics. (MyInfo)

Injuries:
2009: Ectopic pregnancy and was away from the sport for about three months.

Reason:
A local fencing club sent instructors to her school to give a demonstration.
Training:
Opted to resume training with her former coach, Daniel Levavasseur, a renowned French epee master. This decision brought fresh perspective into her fencing style, which had previously been predominantly Italian, now incorporating elements of the French technique (which are two schools of fencing that are known to be rivals of the sport).
""What is funny is that the French school was born to [rival] the Italian one. So somehow as an Italian, I came to Paris to do the opposite of what [the] Italians taught me, so [that] was the paradox of the story."" (olympics.com, 23 July 2021)

Start:
Her parents introduced her and her brother to swimming, judo and jazz to occupy their time while they worked all day. At three years old, she joined her brother in judo under his teacher's guidance, and began competing at seven. Her parents provided strong encouragement, often arranging for her and Victor to compete together. ""Since I was little, I always wanted to do everything he did. I got into judo because of him."" (terra.com.br, 16 Jul 2015)
Reason:
She joined the youth judo team and travelled extensively. In 2012, when she was 20, there was a rule change in judo that made it exceptionally challenging for her to continue in judo so she switched to freestyle wrestling. “Because I wanted to go to the Olympics, I saw that wrestling was giving me more opportunities, that I was growing a lot. And I ended up choosing to stay in wrestling. I’ve been there ever since."" (espn.com.br, 2 Nov 2023)","MILESTONES

Start:
Began skateboarding at age 10.
Reason:
Saw her cousin riding a skateboard and asked her grandmother if she could have one. Her father then took her to a skate park where she fell in love with the sport. ""When I got there, I saw so many possibilities of ramps and tricks, it felt like paradise. I wanted to go to the skate park every day, all I could think about was skating, and all I watched on television was skating. Since then, I have not stopped."" (myInfo)
Philosophy:
""Skateboarding taught me many lessons: cheering for other people's victory does not interfere with yours; treating everyone with respect regardless of differences transforms our own existence; if you fall, get up, just like in life."" (doravarella.com.br)
""When I began skateboarding, it was rare to find another girl in the park. I have always skated with men, and it did not bother me. Little by little, the scenery has changed, and we can see girls skateboarding everywhere. When you enjoy being on a skateboard, there is no difference in race, gender or age that may stop you from having fun."" (myInfo)","MILESTONES
